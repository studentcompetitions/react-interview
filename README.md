# House of Education - React interview

This some boilerplate for an (extremely) simplified version of our matching quiz. It includes some common libraries like:

- Ramda
- React router
- Redux

They're included for convenience, you don't have to use them unless you want to. You're also welcome to add any other libraries you'd like to use.

## The challenge

Todays task is to add functionality to the boilerplate, so that a user can click through all of the questions. Presented one at the time. And display feedback based on the answers at the end of the quiz.
